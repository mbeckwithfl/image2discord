# image2discord
Matt's first formal project. Right click an image in Chrome and send to user-defined Discord channel via webhook.
This was inspired by the problem of constantly right clicking, saving, manually uploading, and then deleting image files from the Web after sending them. 
This Chrome extension simplifies & automates the process of sharing images with friends & co-workers on Discord. 
You can send images to the Discord channel of your choosing in only two clicks.
It also presents a simpler UI and back-end configuration than other available options.
Specifically, it avoids creating, storing and iterating through lists/arrays/maps of user data, using Chrome's storage API instead, so less compute power is needed.
